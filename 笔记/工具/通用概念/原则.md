稳固地存在于内心中，不会被外界环境因素动摇的信念[^1]。

> A **principle** is a proposition or value that is ==a guide for behavior or evaluation==. In law, it is a rule that has to be or usually is to be followed. It can be desirably followed, or it can be an inevitable consequence of something, such as the laws observed in nature or the way that a system is constructed. The principles of such a system are understood by its users as the essential characteristics of the system, or reflecting system's designed purpose, and the effective operation or use of which would be impossible if any one of the principles was to be ignored. A system may be explicitly based on and implemented from a document of principles as was done in IBM's 360/370 Principles of Operation.

> Examples of principles are, entropy in a number of fields, least action in physics, those in descriptive comprehensive and fundamental law: doctrines or assumptions forming normative rules of conduct, separation of church and state in statecraft, the central dogma of molecular biology, fairness in ethics, etc.

> In common English, it is a substantive and collective term referring to rule governance, the absence of which, being "unprincipled", is considered a character defect. It may also be used to declare that a reality has diverged from some ideal or norm as when something is said to be true only "in principle" but not in fact.

 如：不论如何行为，我都没有违背自己的原则。（深埋心中，永远在警告自己的规则）

# 作用
1. 规定行为、思考的指引方向[^2]。风向标
# 理解
1. 原理类似于“实体”，“客观事实”，但后者是独立存在，不受人的主观意识影响。前者也是自己可以独立存在，但是不受环境影响（后者宾语是人的意识，前者是范围更大的环境）
2. 学习“原理”时，想象一个大齿轮机械，在这个学科的底部运行着。每个齿轮就是这个学科的底层支撑，只能待在这里，。

# 提问
如何把一些重要的理念深入人心到，就像是自己的原则？

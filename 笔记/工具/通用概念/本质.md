定义
	1. 
> **essence** (Latin: essentia) is a polysemic term, used in philosophy and theology as a designation for *the property or ==set of properties* that make an entity== or substance *what it fundamentally is*, and ==which it has by necessity==, and ==without which it loses its identity==. Essence is contrasted with ==accident==: a property that the entity or substance has contingently, **without which the substance can still retain its identity**.  
>
> The concept originates rigorously with Aristotle (although it can also be found in Plato), who used the Greek expression to ti ên einai (τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι, literally meaning "the what it was to be" and corresponding to the scholastic term quiddity) or sometimes the shorter phrase to ti esti (τὸ τί ἐστι, literally meaning "the what it is" and corresponding to the scholastic term haecceity) for the same idea. This phrase presented such difficulties for its Latin translators that they coined the word essentia (English "essence") to represent the whole expression. For Aristotle and his scholastic followers, the notion of essence is closely linked to that of definition (ὁρισμός horismos).In the history of Western philosophy, essence has often served as a vehicle for doctrines that tend to individuate different forms of existence as well as different identity conditions for objects and properties; in this logical meaning, the concept has given a strong theoretical and common-sense basis to the whole family of logical theories based on the "possible worlds" analogy set up by Leibniz and developed in the intensional logic from Carnap to Kripke, which was later challenged by "extensionalist" philosophers such as Quine.

# 步骤
面临一个复杂且多面的问题时
1. 识别并忽略所有的==干扰特征==，分离出**问题本质**的核心内容
	1. 真正的问题往往都会被历史，背景，环境包围和掩盖
	2. 你会发现，系统性地将一个问题删除干扰项，削减到本质问题时，这个本质问题极其清晰，容易处理。难在去除干扰与杂乱，混乱。
	3. 每个复杂问题都会包含多个==核心概念==，不必找到所有/最本质的概念，找到其中一个即可，消减成一个**具体话题**。
2. 分析这个核心问题，把理解应用到更宏大的**整体问题**。

> An **argument** is a statement or group of ==statements called premises intended to determine the degree of truth or acceptability of another statement called conclusion==. Arguments can be studied from three main perspectives: the logical, the dialectical and the rhetorical perspective.In logic, an argument is usually expressed not in natural language but in a symbolic formal language, and it can be defined as any group of propositions of which one is claimed to follow from the others through deductively valid inferences that preserve truth from the premises to the conclusion. This logical perspective on argument is relevant for scientific fields such as math and computer science. Logic is the study of the forms of reasoning in arguments and the development of standards and criteria to evaluate arguments. Deductive arguments can be valid, and the valid ones can be sound: in a valid argument, premisses necessitate the conclusion, even if one or more of the premises is false and the conclusion is false; in a sound argument, true premises necessitate a true conclusion. Inductive arguments, by contrast, can have different degrees of logical strength: the stronger or more cogent the argument, the greater the probability that the conclusion is true, the weaker the argument, the lesser that probability. The standards for evaluating non-deductive arguments may rest on different or additional criteria than truth—for example, the persuasiveness of so-called "indispensability claims" in transcendental arguments, the quality of hypotheses in retroduction, or even the disclosure of new possibilities for thinking and acting.In dialectics, and also in a more colloquial sense, an argument can be conceived as a social and verbal means of trying to resolve, or at least contend with, a conflict or difference of opinion that has arisen or exists between two or more parties. For the rhetorical perspective, the argument is constitutively linked with the context, in particular with the time and place in which the argument is located. From this perspective, the argument is evaluated not just by two parties (as in a dialectical approach) but also by an audience. In both dialectic and rhetoric, arguments are used not through a formal but through natural language. Since classical antiquity, philosophers and rhetoricians have developed lists of argument types in which premises and conclusions are connected in informal and defeasible ways.

> A **premise** or premiss is a true or false statement that helps form the body of an argument, which logically leads to a true or false conclusion. A premise makes a declarative statement about its subject matter which enables a reader to either agree or disagree with the premise in question, and in doing so understand the logical assumptions of the argument. If a premise is logically false, then the conclusion, which follows from all of the premises of the argument, must also be false—unless the conclusion is supported by a logically valid argument which the reader agrees with. Therefore, if the reader disagrees with any one of the argument's premises, they have a logical basis to reject the conclusion of the argument.

> A **principle** is a proposition or value that is ==a guide for behavior or evaluation==. In law, it is a rule that has to be or usually is to be followed. It can be desirably followed, or it can be an inevitable consequence of something, such as the laws observed in nature or the way that a system is constructed. The principles of such a system are understood by its users as the essential characteristics of the system, or reflecting system's designed purpose, and the effective operation or use of which would be impossible if any one of the principles was to be ignored. A system may be explicitly based on and implemented from a document of principles as was done in IBM's 360/370 Principles of Operation.
>
> Examples of principles are, entropy in a number of fields, least action in physics, those in descriptive comprehensive and fundamental law: doctrines or assumptions forming normative rules of conduct, separation of church and state in statecraft, the central dogma of molecular biology, fairness in ethics, etc.
>
> In common English, it is a substantive and collective term referring to rule governance, the absence of which, being "unprincipled", is considered a character defect. It may also be used to declare that a reality has diverged from some ideal or norm as when something is said to be true only "in principle" but not in fact.

> **analogy**  is a ==cognitive process of transferring information== or meaning ==from a particular subject== (the analog, or source) ==to another== (the target), or a linguistic expression corresponding to such a process. In a narrower sense, analogy is an inference or an argument ==from one particular to another particular==, as opposed to deduction, induction, and abduction, in which at least one of the premises, or the conclusion, is general rather than particular in nature. The term analogy can also refer to ==the relation== between the source and the target themselves, which is often (though not always) a similarity, as in the biological notion of analogy.
>
> Analogy plays a significant role in ==problem solving==, as well as ==decision making==, ==argumentation, perception, generalization, memory, creativity, invention, prediction, emotion, explanation, conceptualization and communication==. It ==lies behind basic tasks== such as the identification of places, objects and people, for example, in face perception and facial recognition systems. It has been argued that analogy is "the core of cognition". Specific analogical language comprises exemplification, comparisons, metaphors, similes, allegories, and parables, but not metonymy. Phrases like and so on, and the like, as if, and the very word like also rely on an analogical understanding by the receiver of a message including them. Analogy is important not only in ordinary language and common sense (where proverbs and idioms give many examples of its application) but also in science, philosophy, law and the humanities. The concepts of association, comparison, correspondence, mathematical and morphological homology, homomorphism, iconicity, isomorphism, metaphor, resemblance, and similarity are closely related to analogy. In cognitive linguistics, the notion of conceptual metaphor may be equivalent to that of analogy. Analogy is also a basis for any comparative arguments as well as experiments whose results are transmitted to objects that have been not under examination (e.g., experiments on rats when results are applied to humans).
>
> Analogy has been studied and discussed since classical antiquity by philosophers, scientists, theologists and lawyers. The last few decades have shown a renewed interest in analogy, most notably in cognitive science.

> **Deductive reasoning** is the ==mental process of drawing deductive inferences==. An inference is deductively valid if its conclusion follows logically from its premises, i.e. ==if it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false.== For example, the inference from the premises "all men are mortal" and "Socrates is a man" to the conclusion "Socrates is mortal" is deductively valid. ==An argument is sound if it is valid and all its premises are true==. Some theorists define **deduction** in terms of the intentions of the author: they have to intend for the premises to offer deductive support to the conclusion. With the help of this modification, it is possible to distinguish valid from invalid deductive reasoning: it is invalid if the author's belief about the deductive support is false, but **even invalid deductive reasoning is a form of deductive reasoning**. 
> 
> Deductive reasoning is the ==psychological process== of drawing deductive [inferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference "Inference"). ==An inference is a set of [premises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premise "Premise") together with a conclusion==. This psychological process starts from the premises and [reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason "Reason") to a conclusion based on and supported by these premises. If the reasoning was done correctly, it results in a [valid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(logic) "Validity (logic)") deduction: the truth of the premises ensures the truth of the conclusion.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning#cite_note-Johnson-Laird2009-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning#cite_note-Houde-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning#cite_note-Schechter-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning#cite_note-4) For example, in the [syllogistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism "Syllogism") argument "all frogs are reptiles; no cats are reptiles; therefore, no cats are frogs" the conclusion is true because its two premises are true. But even arguments with wrong premises can be deductively valid if they obey this principle, as in "all frogs are mammals; no cats are mammals; therefore, no cats are frogs". If the premises of a valid [argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument "Argument") are true, then it is called a [sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundness "Soundness") argument.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning#cite_note-Evans-5)
> 
>The relation between the premises and the conclusion of a deductive argument is usually referred to as "[logical consequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_consequence "Logical consequence")". According to [Alfred Tarski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Tarski "Alfred Tarski"), logical consequence has 3 essential features: it is necessary, formal, and knowable [a priori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori "A priori").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning#cite_note-IEPLogical-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning#cite_note-Tarski-7) It is necessary in the sense that the premises of valid deductive arguments necessitate the conclusion: it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false, independent of any other circumstances.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning#cite_note-IEPLogical-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning#cite_note-Tarski-7) Logical consequence is formal in the sense that it depends only on the form or the syntax of the premises and the conclusion. This means that the validity of a particular argument does not depend on the specific contents of this argument. If it is valid, then any argument with the same logical form is also valid, no matter how different it is on the level of its contents.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning#cite_note-IEPLogical-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning#cite_note-Tarski-7) Logical consequence is knowable a priori in the sense that no [empirical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical "Empirical") knowledge of the world is necessary to determine whether a deduction is valid. So it is not necessary to engage in any form of empirical investigation.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning#cite_note-IEPLogical-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning#cite_note-Tarski-7) Some logicians define deduction in terms of [possible worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possible_world "Possible world"): A deductive inference is valid if and only if, there is no possible world in which its conclusion is false while its premises are true. This means that there are no counterexamples: the conclusion is true in _all_ such cases, not just in _most_ cases

> **Inductive reasoning** is a method of reasoning in which a body of observations is considered to derive a general principle. It consists of ==making broad generalizations based on specific observations==. Inductive reasoning is distinct from deductive reasoning. If the premises are correct, the conclusion of a deductive argument is certain; in contrast, the truth of the conclusion of an inductive argument is ==probable==, based upon the evidence given.

> In logic and linguistics, a **==proposition==** is the **meaning** of a declarative sentence. In philosophy, "meaning" is understood to be a non-linguistic entity which is shared by all sentences with the same meaning. Equivalently, a proposition is the non-linguistic bearer of truth or falsity which makes any sentence that expresses it either true or false.
>
> While the term "proposition" may sometimes be used in everyday language to refer to a linguistic statement which can be either true or false, the technical philosophical term, which differs from the mathematical usage, refers exclusively to the non-linguistic meaning behind the statement. The term is often used very broadly and can also refer to various related concepts, both in the history of philosophy and in contemporary analytic philosophy. It can generally be used to refer to some or all of the following: The primary bearers of truth values (such as "true" and "false"); the objects of belief and other propositional attitudes (i.e. what is believed, doubted, etc.); the referents of "that"-clauses (e.g. "It is true that the sky is blue" and "I believe that the sky is blue" both involve the proposition the sky is blue); and the meanings of declarative sentences.Since propositions are defined as the sharable objects of attitudes and the primary bearers of truth and falsity, this means that the term "proposition" does not refer to particular thoughts or particular utterances (which are not sharable across different instances), nor does it refer to concrete events or facts (which cannot be false). Propositional logic deals primarily with propositions and logical relations between them.
